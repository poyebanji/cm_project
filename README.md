Project 3.

Face Recognition

A react app that takes pictures URL and detect the faces in the picture.
A udemy code along that does only one face. This app detect as many faces on the picture. It uses API to process the image and send back json data of the frames.

The App is hosted on heroku https://smart-brain-pet.herokuapp.com/

Inspirations

GitHub - Code storage and version control with ability to reset to any point. Simple to use.

Smart Brain App - the instructor only show how to detect one face in a picture, I extended the app to detect all faces in a picture.

Artizia - So many selling app out there, we wanted to create an app exclusively for artist to show case their products and find home for their items.

Since I started my programing journey, I see web pages differently these question pops up.

 is the site static or dynamic?

 what is the engine behind site - JavaScripts, react, angular ...?

 does it have server and database?

 any new feature?

 color schemes?

Focus

UX/UI - website functionality and easy to use with screen appeal.

Scrum Master - to gain confidence managing projects and deliveries
